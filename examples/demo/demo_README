demo.tif 
        - overview model
Koenig2012_demo.xml
        - SBML for model
Koenig2012_demo_FD_*.val
        - example flux distributions in model
CreateDemoNetwork.java
        - Java script for generating model and flux distributions
CyFluxViz_v0.82beta.jar
        - CyFluxViz plugin (replace the old FluxViz.jar)
erythrocyte folder
        - more complex example

---------------------------------------------
[1] Install CySBML and the new CyFluxViz version. This version will be released
        any day. FluxViz was almost completely written from scratch to support
        multiple networks and have dramatic speed improvements for larger networks.
        The CyFluxViz_v0.82beta.jar Version already supports the basic features
        of FluxViz but still has some bugs in the subnetwork generation.
        For the basic visualization this is no problem at all.

[2] Load demo network with CySBML
[3] Load val files via the CyFluxViz val import dialog and select the 
        Flux Distribution you want to display
[4] More complex example in the erythrocyte folder.

If you have questions just write.
Kind regards,
Matthias König
